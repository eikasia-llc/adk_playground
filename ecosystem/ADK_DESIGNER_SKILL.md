<!-- content -->
The `ecosystem/` project is a **visual multi-agent architecture designer** built with React + React Flow. It lets you design ADK multi-agent pipelines by dragging and connecting nodes on a canvas, then exporting a working `agent.py` file.

Think of it as a local, ADK-specific version of [n8n](https://n8n.io/).

## Running the Designer
```bash
cd ecosystem
npm install        # first time only
npm run dev        # opens http://localhost:5173
```

For a production build:
```bash
npm run build      # outputs to ecosystem/dist/
npm run preview    # serves the build locally
```

## Information Flow Model
Every pipeline on the canvas is a directed graph of **information flow** — data moves from node to node, being transformed at each step. Edges represent the path information travels, not just which agent controls which.

### Single-turn flow (default)
The canonical shape is linear:

```
👤 Human → [agents / tools] → Output
```

The **Human node is the entry point**: it represents the user's request entering the system. Information flows forward through LLM agents, tools, and workflow orchestrators until a final output is produced. The Human node appears **once** per pipeline.

### Looping pipeline
When the task requires iteration — e.g., "keep refining until the output is good enough" — the pipeline is wrapped in a `LoopAgent`:

```
👤 Human → LoopAgent ┐
                     ├─ [processing agents]
                     └─ ✅ Evaluator  ──(exit_loop if satisfied)──► Output
```

The `LoopAgent` re-runs its sub-agents on each iteration. The **Evaluator node** sits at the end of the loop and checks the current output against a success condition. If satisfied, it calls `exit_loop` and the pipeline terminates. If not, the loop continues up to `max_iterations`.

### Stop conditions
Stop conditions are expressed as properties of the **Evaluator node**:

| Field | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `success_condition` | Natural-language rubric the LLM evaluator checks against (e.g., *"The answer is factually correct and under 200 words"*) |
| `model` | Which LLM judges the output |

`max_iterations` on the parent `LoopAgent` acts as the hard upper bound regardless of the success condition.

### Flow visualization
Active flow edges render **animated particles** (3 glowing dots) traveling in the direction of the arrow, making the information path visible at a glance.

- **Particle speed** is controlled by `data.speed` on each edge (seconds per traversal, default 2.5). This field is reserved for future latency/speed analysis.
- **Stuck nodes** — any non-Human, non-information node with no outgoing edges — are highlighted with a pulsing amber ring. This flags dead-ends in the pipeline where flow enters but cannot continue.
- **Information Set edges** (Database, Context) carry data/reference rather than active flow. They render as plain edges with no particles, visually distinguishing passive data from active processing.
- **Edge name labels** — if `data.name` is set on an edge, it is rendered as a small colored pill at the midpoint of the curve.

### Edge semantics
Every active flow connection produces **two directed edges**: a forward *call* edge and a reverse *response* edge. Both carry identical animated particles. Color indicates the relationship:

| Color | Style | Direction | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Indigo | Solid, animated | Workflow → sub-agent | Orchestration call |
| Orange | Solid, animated | LLM agent → agent | Delegation call |
| Teal | Dashed, animated | Agent → Tool / MCP | Tool call |
| Pink | Dashed | LLM agent → A2UI Response | Output contract (no return edge) |
| Same color | Dashed, animated | Reverse of above | Response / result returning |
| Gray | Plain, no particles | Any → Database / Context | Passive data access (no return) |

The forward and return edges are **separate, independently routable arrows** — each connects through a specific handle (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`) on the source and target nodes. This lets you route them on different paths to avoid visual crossings.

## Node Types
### Active flow nodes
These nodes participate in information flow and connect with animated particle edges.

| Node | Palette group | Color | ADK Class | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 👤 Human / User | (standalone) | Yellow | — | Entry point: the user's request entering the pipeline. Appears once. |
| 🤖 LLM Agent | (standalone) | Blue | `LlmAgent` | Intelligent agent driven by an LLM |
| ➡️ Sequential | Workflow Agents | Green | `SequentialAgent` | Runs sub-agents one after another |
| ⚡ Parallel | Workflow Agents | Purple | `ParallelAgent` | Runs sub-agents concurrently |
| 🔄 Loop | Workflow Agents | Orange | `LoopAgent` | Iterates sub-agents until exit signal or max iterations |
| ✅ Evaluator | Workflow Agents | Emerald | `LlmAgent` + `exit_loop` | Checks output against a success condition; exits loop when satisfied. Always place last inside a Loop. |
| 🔧 Tool | Tools | Gray | Python function | Custom callable tool for an LlmAgent |
| 🔌 MCP Toolset | Tools | Teal | `McpToolset` | Connects an external MCP server to an LlmAgent |

### Output contract nodes
These nodes sit at the **output boundary** of the pipeline and define the response format expected by the frontend. They do not generate Python agent code themselves; instead they modify the instruction of the connected LLM agent.

| Node | Palette group | Color | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🎨 A2UI Response | Output Contracts | Pink | Declares that a connected LLM Agent returns structured A2UI JSON. Configures which component types are enabled and which renderer will consume them. |

Connect an `A2UIResponse` node from an `LlmAgent` using a **response edge** (pink dashed). The code generator will automatically append the correct A2UI instruction block to that agent's `instruction`, listing only the component types enabled on the node.

### Information Set nodes
These nodes represent passive data sources. Their edges carry no flow particles and they do not trigger stuck-node warnings. They are of a fundamentally different nature from active flow nodes.

Information Sets are split into two sub-groups in the palette:

#### 🗄️ Data Stores — tool-facing
| Node | Palette group | Color | ADK concept | Code gen |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🗄️ Database | Information Sets | Violet | External data store a tool queries/writes (SQL, NoSQL, vector DB) | Emits a `query_<name>(query: str) -> str` stub function |
| 📄 Artifact Store | Information Sets | Amber | Files/blobs produced or consumed during a session (`ArtifactService`) | Emits `InMemoryArtifactService()` or `GcsArtifactService(bucket_name=...)` + Runner comment |

#### 🧠 Memory — LLM-facing
| Node | Palette group | Color | ADK concept | Code gen |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 📋 Context | Information Sets | Cyan | Static knowledge appended to a connected agent's `instruction` | Appends `content` to the connected LlmAgent's `instruction` field |
| 🔄 Session State | Information Sets | Emerald | Shared key-value store within a pipeline run (`session.state` / `output_key`) | Emits a comment block documenting all state keys |
| 🧠 Memory | Information Sets | Indigo | Cross-session semantic retrieval (`MemoryService`) | Emits `InMemoryMemoryService()` or `VertexAiRagMemoryService(...)` + Runner comment |

## How to Use
### Palette groups
The left sidebar organises nodes into collapsible groups. Click a group header to expand it:

| Group | Contents |
| :--- | :--- |
| (standalone) | LLM Agent, Human / User |
| 🔀 Workflow Agents | Sequential, Parallel, Loop, Evaluator |
| 🧰 Tools | Tool, MCP Toolset |
| 🎨 Output Contracts | A2UI Response |
| 🗂️ Information Sets | 🗄️ Data Stores: Database, Artifact Store — 🧠 Memory: Context, Session State, Memory |

### Building a pipeline
1. **Drag** a node from the left palette onto the canvas.
2. **Connect** nodes by dragging from any handle to another node's handle. A forward call edge and its paired return edge are created automatically.
3. **Click any node** to open its properties in the right panel. Edit name, model, instruction, output_key, max_iterations, success_condition, DB type, content, etc.
4. **Click any edge** to open its properties in the right panel. Edit name, description, and handle assignments.
5. All nodes are **resizable**: select a node and drag the corner/edge handles.

### Edge types
- **Sub-agent edge** (indigo, animated + particles): workflow agent → child agents.
- **Delegate edge** (orange, particles): LLM agent → another agent.
- **Tool edge** (teal dashed, particles): any agent → Tool or MCP Toolset.
- **Response edge** (pink dashed): LLM agent → A2UI Response (output contract).
- **Information edge** (gray, no particles): any agent → Database or Context.

Every active flow connection also produces a **return edge** — a separate dashed arrow running in the opposite direction via the `bottom` handle on both nodes, representing the response or result flowing back. Both directions carry animated particles at the same speed and brightness.

### Editing edges
Click any edge to open it in the property panel:

| Field | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Name** | Short label rendered as a pill at the edge midpoint on the canvas |
| **Description** | Longer annotation stored on the edge, visible only in the panel |
| **From handle** | Which side of the source node the edge departs from (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`) |
| **To handle** | Which side of the target node the edge arrives at |

The handle picker shows a mini node diagram with four buttons arranged around a box. The active handle is highlighted in the edge's color. Changing handles immediately reroutes the edge curve — use this to untangle crossings between forward and return arrows.

### Stuck node indicator
Any non-Human, non-information node with no outgoing edges is flagged with a **pulsing amber ring**. This means the pipeline has a dead-end at that node — flow enters but cannot continue. Connect an outgoing edge to clear the warning.

### Saving & loading (browser)
- **Save** stores the current canvas as JSON in `localStorage`.
- **Load** restores the last saved design from `localStorage`.

These are quick session saves. For portable, named layouts use presets instead.

### Preset files
Preset files are named JSON files in `ecosystem/presets/`. They carry a `_meta` block plus the full `nodes` and `edges` arrays — including every node's pixel position, size, and all edge handle assignments.

```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "name": "My Pipeline",
    "description": "One-sentence summary.",
    "source_repo": "my_repo",
    "created": "2026-03-28"
  },
  "nodes": [ ... ],
  "edges": [ ... ]
}
```

When a preset is loaded and then exported again via **Export Preset**, React Flow adds runtime fields to node objects (`measured`, `selected`, `dragging`, `resizing`). These are harmless — React Flow uses them on reload and they do not affect Python export.

**Loading a preset:** Click **Load File** → select the `.json` file. The canvas is replaced with the saved layout.

**Saving a layout back to a preset:** After loading a preset and arranging nodes and edges to your liking, click **Export Preset**. The browser downloads a `.json` named after `_meta.name`, containing the current canvas state (positions, sizes, handle assignments, edge labels) with the original `_meta` intact. Replace the file in `ecosystem/presets/` to persist the layout.

**The round-trip: Load File → arrange on canvas → Export Preset → overwrite the file.**

### Exporting Python
Click **Export Python** in the toolbar — the browser downloads an `agent.py` file. When a preset with `_meta` is loaded, the file begins with a module docstring:

```python
"""
My Pipeline
===========
One-sentence summary.

Source: my_repo
Generated: 2026-03-28 by ADK Agent Designer
"""
```

The generator then:
1. Emits imports for only the node types present on the canvas.
2. Emits tool function defs and MCP toolset factories (leaves first).
3. Emits agent instantiations in topological order.
4. Assigns `root_agent` to the top-level workflow agent.
5. For any `LlmAgent` with a **response** edge to an `A2UIResponse` node, appends the A2UI instruction block (listing only the enabled component types) to that agent's `instruction` field automatically.

## Extending the Designer
| Extension | How to add |
| :--- | :--- |
| **New active node type** | Add to `AgentKind` in `types/agent.ts`, create a component in `nodes/`, add to `PALETTE_ITEMS`, handle in `codeGenerator.ts` |
| **New information node type** | Same as above, plus add the kind to `INFO_KINDS` in `App.tsx` so its edges skip particles |
| **New output contract node type** | Same as above, plus add the kind to `TERMINAL_KINDS` in `App.tsx` so it doesn't trigger stuck-node warnings |
| **New A2UI component type** | Add to `A2UI_ALL_COMPONENTS` in `types/agent.ts`; add its schema string in `codeGenerator.ts` → `schemas` map |
| **New model option** | Add to the `<select>` in `PropertyPanel.tsx` |
| **Edge latency / speed** | Set `data.speed` (seconds) on an edge — `FlowEdge.tsx` reads it to control particle travel time |
| **Persist to file** | Use **Export Preset** — saves full layout as a `.json` preset file |
| **Load existing agent.py** | Write a Python → graph JSON parser (reverse of `codeGenerator.ts`) |
| **Auto-layout** | Integrate `@dagrejs/dagre` to arrange nodes automatically after import |
